# Primary Assignment Objectives
This project was geared towards further familiarization with constructing good looking, dynamic HTML that guides the user through interaction with page elements and game logic. It was also an opportunity to exercise jQuery selectors and methods to change the DOM, and a robust experiment in building a more complex Javascript game engine that could build out and display characters, enable free user choice for battle match-ups, and modify score values to determine winners and losers. Core challenges included:
* Setting up base HTML for easy reading and writing with jQuery
* Styling page elements with CSS to display well and guide users
* Structure Javascript objects and functions to drive character representation, battle matchups and game-state changes
* Create a logical game-flow the user can easily follow to logical end-states for wins and losses

# Personal Learning Challenges and Successes
When I began this project I did extensive pseudo-coding and got very in depth with the details and ambitious ideas I had for how it would look and respond to user input. While this was fun and led to some cool features, it also led me into some weeds that made my overall development slow. As I got caught up in trying to get my visual design to behave in specific ways, I lost track of my overall game flow and basic objectives. 

The experience of getting lost in the project's depth was good though, because it provided some valuable lessons in prioritizing and debugging, as well as troubleshooting unfamiliar processes and utilizing the help of others in class and Stack Overflow to continue making slow but steady progress. Because of this experience, I was able to approach my next project more efficiently.

Some valuable lessons included:
* Using Stack Overflow to get guidance on jQuery and Javascript practices
* Practice with debugging and logging to slowly work out kinks
* Experience re-writing large sections of game logic and re-contextualizing an already complex program
* Heavy utilization of Git along multiple branches for the many stages of game development
* Measured compromise of more ambitious features in order to arrive at a satisfactory, working product
